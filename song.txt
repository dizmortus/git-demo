Gustavus! Adolphus!
Libera et impera!
Acerbus et ingens!
Augusta per augusta

A storm over Europe unleashed,
Dawn of war, a trail of destruction
The power of Rome won’t prevail,
See the catholics shiver and shake

The future of warfare unveiled,
Showed the way, that we still walk today
Der Lowe aus Mitternacht comes,
Once more, he is here, for war
